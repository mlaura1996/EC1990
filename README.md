The Eurocode Core Ontology (ECO) is a formal OWL ontology that encodes the logic and terminology of the Eurocodesâ€”a suite of harmonized European standards governing structural design and safety. These standards are central to engineering practice across Europe but are currently published only in natural language documents, which limits their utility in automated verification, compliance checking, and digital design workflows.

ECO addresses this limitation by providing a machine-readable semantic model of the foundational content in Eurocode 0 (EN 1990:2002) and key concepts from Eurocode 1 (EN 1991). It captures essential constructs such as design situations, limit states, actions, combinations of actions, resistances, and structural members, along with the logic used in structural verification. The ontology supports hierarchical classification, multilingual labels, normative referencing, and quantitative modeling using standard unit systems.

ECO is aligned with established vocabularies and ontologies, including QUDT (quantities and units), BFO and EMMO (top-level ontologies), SKOS (concept schemes), and built environment models such as BOT and BEO. It is designed to support inference-based validation and rule execution through SHACL, SPARQL, and SWRL, and can be extended with domain-specific modules for materials, construction types, and geometric descriptions.

The ECO namespace is https://w3id.org/eurocodes/en1990, with the suggested prefix ec:.
As a core vocabulary, ECO is intended to interoperate with other semantic resources to support intelligent design assistants, BIM-integrated compliance tools, and digital twins for the AECO sector. It lays the foundation for moving from document-driven interpretation of design standards to automation-ready, semantically enriched engineering.
